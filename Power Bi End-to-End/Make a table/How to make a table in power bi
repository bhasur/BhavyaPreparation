Step 1 - Make a Sample visualization
Here we are going to make a sample visualization, for that we are going to use columns Country, Gross sales, Profit, Unit sold, Year 
which will give us a default visualization

Step 2 - Select Table
Go to the visualization pane and select a table from there which will convert our default visualization to a table and as per our requirement we can do formatting 
to our table by using the format field under the visualization
