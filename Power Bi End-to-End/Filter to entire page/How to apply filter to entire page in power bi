Step 1 - Description of how to apply a filter on an entire page
If we have 2 to 3 or more visualizations on a single page and if we want to apply a filter that will apply to all the visualizations present onto the entire 
page then this is possible using the Page filter.

Step 2 - What output we are expecting?
We want to see the Country wise sales, Country-wise profit, and Country wise unit sold. Where we are going to make 3 different visualizations

Step 3 - Drag and drop the columns
Drag and drop the Country and Sales column onto the task window and select a chart from the visualization pane. Drag and drop the Country and Profit column 
onto the task window and select a chart from the visualization pane. Drag and drop Country and Unit sold column onto the task window and select a chart from the
visualization pane.

Step 4 - Apply Filter.
In our case, if we want to apply a filter to Country which will apply to all the visualizations present on the entire page then drag and drop the Country column
onto the "Filters on this page field" under the Filters pane and select the countries that we want to showcase. This can be done in other fields also.
