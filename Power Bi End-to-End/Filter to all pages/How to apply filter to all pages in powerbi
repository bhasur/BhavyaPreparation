Step 1 - Description of how to apply a filter on all pages
If we are having different visualizations on different pages in power bi then we can apply a single filter to them 
by using the "filters on all pages" field under the filters pane.

Note - We are going to use the sample dataset already present in power bi which is the Financial dataset.

Step 2 - What output we are expecting?
We want to see gross sales, profit and unit sold according to the product.

Step 3 - Drag and drop the columns
Drag and drop the gross sales and product column onto the first page, and select a graph from the visualization pane. 
Drag and drop the Profit and product column onto the second page, and select a graph from the visualization pane. 
Drag and drop the unit sold and product column onto the third page, and select a graph from the visualization pane.

Step 4 - Apply Filter.
In our case, we have made 3 different visualizations on 3 different pages and we are going to apply a filter to all the pages, so, for now, 
we want to apply a filter for product lets drag and drop product column on filters on all pages field and select the products accordingly.
