A combination chart is a visualization that displays a line chart and bar chart in a single chart, each of which represents a different category.

Task - Make a combo chart(Line and Clustered Column chart) where the line chart is showing a month-wise trend of sales and the bar chart is showing a month-wise 
trend of profit.


Step 1 - Open power bi report
Step 2 - Add 'Line and Clustered Column chart' visual in power bi report.
To add 'Line and Clustered Column chart', go to Visualization pane -> Drag and drop 'Line and Clustered Column chart' visual in power bi report.

Step 3 - Add fields into the 'Line and Clustered Column chart' visual
Put Order Date in Shared axis, and since we want month-wise trend, only keep Month in Order Date hierarchy.

Put Profit in Column values and Sales in Line values.

In this way, we can make and use Combo charts in the power bi report.
