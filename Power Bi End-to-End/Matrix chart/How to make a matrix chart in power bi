Step 1 - What is a Matrix chart?
In a Dataset, these are the charts that show the relationship between the two or more variables. For the representation of data in grid format, 
it is made up of columns and rows. To create this chart we require at least two variables if any other third or fourth variable 
is there then color or other dimensions can be added to the matrix for representing the data.

Step 2 - Make Sample visualization
We are going to make a sample visualization using the columns Country, Customer ID, Quantity, Unit Price. Which will give us a default visualization

Step 3 - Select Matrix chart
Go to the visualization pane and select a matrix chart from there which will convert the default visualization into a matrix chart.
