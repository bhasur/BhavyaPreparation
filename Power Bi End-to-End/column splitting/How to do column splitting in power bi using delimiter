Step 1 - What is a delimiter?
Splitting using delimiter means we can split the columns by using delimiters which can be:

"Comma" "," "Colon" ";" "Space" " " "Semi-colon" ":" "Custom" in this we can add delimiter as per our data

Note - The dataset that we are going to use is the Customer details dataset which consists of two columns Customer ID and Customer Name.

Step 2 - Go to the data pane
On the left-hand side of the window, there are 3 options present select the second one which is a data pane then select the column which you want to split, right-click on it and select Edit Query which will redirect you to the Power query editor.

Step 3 - Split column
In the Power Query editor in the Home tab, there is an option available "Split Column" click onto that option and a new window will be opened up which will 
show you the options for splitting the column, then select the delimiter by which you want to split the column in our case we are using "space" delimiter after 
that select from where you want to split it like the "left-most", "right-most", and "Each occurrence" in our case we are selecting the "left-most".
At last click on OK and a new column will be generated with the split values in it.
