Step 1 - Select Slicer
Go to the visualization pane and select the slicer to drag it onto the task window.

Step 2 - Drag a numeric value.
From the columns select a numeric value column and drag it to the slicer, in our case we are using the gross sales column

Step 3 - Make a Sample visualization
In our case, we are going to make a profit vs product and Unit sold vs product, so when we apply slicer on it the changes were taking place.
