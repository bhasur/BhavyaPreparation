Step 1 - Definition of Guage chart
A Guage chat is a chart which is having a circular ARC and showing a single value that measures the progress towards a goal or a KPI i.e key performance indicator

Note - We are going to use the sample dataset already present in power bi which is the Financial dataset.

Step 2 - What output we are expecting?
We want to see the gross sales in the financial data.

Step 3 - Drag and drop the columns
Drag and drop the "Gross Sales" and making some customizations use the other columns as well.

Step 4 - Make a Guage chart.
So for making a Guage chart we have to the visualization pane and from there select "Guage chart" which will convert the default chart into Guage chart, 
for more customizations drag and drop the columns into Target, minimum and maximum fields
