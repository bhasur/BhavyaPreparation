Aster Plot is a twist on a standard Donut chart which is an in-built visual in power bi. There is no built-in Aster plot visualization, so we have to import it.

It allows us to use 2 measures: The first measure controls the depth of each section and the Second measure controls the width of each section.

Task - Make Aster plot which displays Profit(controls the depth) and Sales(controls the width) by Category.


Step 1 - Open power bi report
Step 2 - Import the 'Aster plot' visual in the power bi report.
To import 'Aster plot', go to Visualization pane -> Click on three dots -> Get more visuals -> Search 'Aster plot' -> Add 'Aster plot'

Step 3 - Add the 'Aster plot' visual in the power bi report.
To add 'Aster plot', go to Visualization pane -> Drag and drop 'Aster plot' visual in power bi report.

Step 4 - Add fields into the 'Aster plot' visual
Put 'Category' in the Category field.

First, put 'Profit' in the Y-Axis field and then put 'Sales' in the same field.

In this way, we can make and use the Aster plot in the power bi report.
