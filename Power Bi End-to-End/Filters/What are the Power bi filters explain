Step 1 - Definition of Filters.
Based on the selected criteria the information and data are sorted using filters in power bi. If we want to see some particular values within a 
field and want to view only information related to that then the filter is very useful.

Note - Dataset that we are going to use is "Hollywood most profitable stories" data which is already used by us in our previous video so for Dataset 
Explanation please refer to our previous video "How to Make a Pie chart in Power bi".

Step 2 - What output we are expecting?
So, we would like to see the "Worldwide ratings" according to "genre".

Step 3 - Drag and drop columns
Drag and drop the "Worldwide gross" onto the task window and do the same thing with the "Genre" column

Step 4 - Apply filters
If we go to the filters pane we can see already two fields are there so we can apply the filter on that fields or we can also more fields as per requirement 
into the filters pane. For now, we are going to apply a filter on the genre column and going to select some genres from there.
