4. Write a Python program which accepts the radius of a circle from the user and compute the area. Go to the editor
Sample Output :
r = 1.1
Area = 3.8013271108436504

Python: Area of a Circle

In geometry, the area enclosed by a circle of radius r is πr2. Here the Greek letter π represents a constant, approximately equal to 3.14159, 
which is equal to the ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter.

Sol:

from math import pi
r = float(input("input the radius of the circle"))
print("Area of circle " + str(r) + "is:" , str(pi*r**2))
