(select train_id, arrival_time, departure_time, lead(arrival_time, 1) over(order by ranking asc) as lead
from
(
select a.train_id, arrival_time, departure_time, row_number()over(order by arrival_time asc) as ranking
from train_arrivals a join train_departures d
on a.train_id = d.train_id) A ) B
where lead is null or lead >= departure_time
