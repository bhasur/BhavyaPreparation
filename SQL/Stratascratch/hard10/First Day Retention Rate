    , LEAD(login_date) OVER (partition by player_id ORDER BY login_date ) AS next_date 
from players_logins
)

SELECT cast(count(distinct player_id) as float) / (SELECT  count( distinct                                                  player_id) as a                                         FROM players_logins ) AS retention_rate
FROM cte
WHERE date = next_date
