Sol:

with cte as (
select hire_date as dd, 1 as cc
from uber_employees
union all
select termination_date as dd, -1 as cc
from uber_employees
where termination_date is not null
),

dd_cc as (
select dd, sum(emp_cc) over (order by dd) as emp_cc
from (select dd, sum(cc) as emp_cc
from cte
group by dd) a
),

emp_dd as (
select a.id, b.emp_cc as maxemp, b.dd as date,
row_number () over (partition by a.id order by b.emp_cc desc, b.dd) as rn
from uber_employees a join dd_cc b
on b.dd between a.hire_date and ifnull(a.termination_date, current_date)
)

select id, maxemp, date
from emp_dd
where rn = 1
