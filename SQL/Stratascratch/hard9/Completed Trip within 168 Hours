Sol:

WITH signups AS (
    SELECT *,
         DATE(timestamp)
    FROM signup_events
    WHERE event_name LIKE 'su_success'
        AND DATE(timestamp) BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2022-01-07'
        ),


first_trips_in_168_hours AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT driver_id
    FROM signup_events
    INNER JOIN trip_details 
        ON rider_id = driver_id
    WHERE status LIKE 'completed'
        AND actual_time_of_arrival BETWEEN timestamp AND timestamp + INTERVAL '168' HOUR
        )
                 
                 
SELECT 
    city_id, 
    date, 
    CAST(COUNT(driver_id) AS FLOAT) / COUNT(rider_id) * 100.0 AS percentage
FROM signups
LEFT JOIN first_trips_in_168_hours 
    ON rider_id = driver_id
GROUP BY city_id, date
