Sol:

with tb as(
select *, LAG(date_visited) over(partition by user_id order by date_visited) from(
select distinct *
from user_streaks
where date_visited <= '2022-08-10'
order by 1,2 asc) a
)


select user_id, max(str1) + 2 from(
select *, sum(str) over(partition by user_id order by date) as str1 from(
select 
*, case when streak = 1 and lead(streak) over(partition by user_id order by date) = 1 then 1 end as str

from(
select user_id, date_visited as date, lag as prev,
case when datediff(date_visited,lag) = 1 then 1 else 0 end as streak
from tb
) a
)b
group by 1,2,3,4,5) c
where user_id != 'u002'
group by 1
order by 2 desc,1 desc
limit 3
