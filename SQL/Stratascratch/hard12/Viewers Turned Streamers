Q: https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/2012-viewers-turned-streamers?tabname=solutions


Sol:

-- CTE to filter users who had first session = viewer

-- Step 1: Rank user sessions
WITH cte_1 AS(
SELECT user_id, session_type,
RANK() OVER (partition by user_id ORDER BY session_start) AS posn
FROM twitch_sessions),


-- Step 2 Get users who had first session as viewer
cte_2 AS(
SELECT user_id
FROM cte_1
WHERE posn = 1 AND session_type = 'Viewer'
)

SELECT twitch_sessions.user_id, COUNT(*) AS n_sessions
FROM twitch_sessions, cte_2
WHERE twitch_sessions.user_id IN (cte_2.user_id) AND session_type = 'Streamer'
GROUP BY twitch_sessions.user_id
