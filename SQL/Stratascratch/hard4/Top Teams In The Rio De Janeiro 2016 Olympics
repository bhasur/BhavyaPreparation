Sol:

WITH medal_cte AS (
    SELECT   event,team,COUNT(medal) AS n_medals,ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY event ORDER BY COUNT(medal) DESC) 
            AS team_position
    FROM olympics_athletes_events
    WHERE 
        year = 2016 AND
        medal IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY event, team
    ORDER BY event, team, n_medals)

SELECT
    event,
    COALESCE(MAX(CASE WHEN team_position = 1 THEN CONCAT(team, ' with ', n_medals, ' medals')  ELSE NULL END), 'No Team') AS gold_team,
    COALESCE(MAX(CASE WHEN team_position = 2 THEN CONCAT(team, ' with ', n_medals, ' medals')  ELSE NULL END), 'No Team')  AS silver_team,
    COALESCE(MAX(CASE WHEN team_position = 3 THEN CONCAT(team, ' with ', n_medals, ' medals')  ELSE NULL END), 'No Team')  AS bronze_team    
FROM medal_cte
WHERE team_position <= 3
GROUP BY event
