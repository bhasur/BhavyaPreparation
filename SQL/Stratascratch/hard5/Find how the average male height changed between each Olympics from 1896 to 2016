from (select distinct year, id, height 
from olympics_athletes_events where sex = 'M') s1
group by year)

select year, avg_height, 
coalesce(lag(avg_height, 1) over(order by year), 172.73) as pre_avg_height, 
avg_height - coalesce(lag(avg_height, 1) over(order by year), 172.73) as difference 
from cte 
order by year
