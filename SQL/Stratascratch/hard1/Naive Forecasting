Sol:

WITH m AS (
  SELECT LEFT(request_date, 7) AS month, SUM(distance_to_travel) AS distance_monthly, SUM(monetary_cost) AS cost_monthly
    FROM uber_request_logs
   GROUP BY 1
   ORDER BY 1
  ),

f AS (
SELECT month, distance_monthly / cost_monthly AS actual, LAG(distance_monthly / cost_monthly, 1) OVER (ORDER BY month) AS forecast
  FROM m
)

SELECT ROUND(SQRT(AVG(POWER(actual - forecast, 2))), 2) AS RMSE
FROM f
