Q: https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/9793-average-time-between-steps?tabname=solutions


Sol:

SELECT feature_id, AVG(avg_diff)
FROM
(select a.feature_id, a.user_id,
    AVG(timestampdiff(second, b.timestamp, a.timestamp)) as avg_diff
from facebook_product_features_realizations a JOIN facebook_product_features_realizations b on a.feature_id = b.feature_id and a.user_id = b.user_id
where a.step_reached = (b.step_reached + 1) 
group by a.feature_id, a.user_id) as avg_times
Group BY feature_id
