Sol:

with scroll_down as (select user_id,timestamp,date_format(timestamp, '%Y-%m-%d') as day
from facebook_web_log
where action = 'scroll_down'),
page_load as (
select user_id,timestamp, date_format(timestamp, '%Y-%m-%d') as day
from facebook_web_log
where action = 'page_load'
),
user_time as (
    select sd.user_id, 
    pl.timestamp as load_time, sd.timestamp as scroll_time,
    timestampdiff(second, pl.timestamp,sd.timestamp) as diff
    from 
    scroll_down sd
    inner join
    page_load pl
    on sd.user_id = pl.user_id and sd.day = pl.day
)

select user_id, load_time,scroll_time, time_format(timediff(scroll_time,load_time),'%H:%i:%s')  from user_time where diff = (
    select min(diff) from  
    user_time where diff>=0
)
