Q: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-20/problem

Sol: SELECT CAST(AVG(LAT_N) AS NUMERIC(20,4)) 
FROM (SELECT LAT_N, 
             ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY LAT_N ASC) AS RowAsc, 
             ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY LAT_N DESC) AS RowDesc 
      FROM STATION) x
WHERE RowAsc IN (RowDesc, RowDesc - 1, RowDesc + 1);
