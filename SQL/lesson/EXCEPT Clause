The SQL Server (Transact-SQL) EXCEPT clause is used to compare the result-sets of two or more SELECT statements. 
It returns all records from the first result-set that do not appear in the second result-set.

While using EXCEPT clause, the following criteria must be satisfied:

Number of columns in each SELECT statement should equal.
Datatype of columns in each SELECT statement should match.
Order of columns in each SELECT statement should match.

Syntax
The syntax for using EXCEPT clause in SQL Server (Transact-SQL) is given below:

SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table1
EXCEPT
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table2


Example:
Using EXCEPT clause: To get the records of Name column which are not present in both record-sets, the following query can be used:

SELECT Name FROM Product
EXCEPT
SELECT Name FROM Inventory
ORDER BY Name;

Using EXCEPT clause with WHERE clause: To fetch the records of Name column which are not present in both record-sets with the specified condition, the following query can be used:

SELECT Name FROM Product
EXCEPT
SELECT Name FROM Inventory
WHERE Quantity < 30
ORDER BY Name;

Using EXCEPT clause with multiple columns: To fetch the records of Name and Brand columns which are not present in both record-sets, the following query can be used:

SELECT Name, Brand FROM Product
EXCEPT
SELECT Name, Brand FROM Inventory
ORDER BY Name;
