The SQL Server (Transact-SQL) GROUP BY keyword is used to arrange result table into identical groups with the help of aggregate functions 
(COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM, AVG etc). The GROUP BY keyword follows the WHERE clause in a SELECT statement and precedes the ORDER BY keyword.

Syntax
The syntax for using GROUP BY Keyword in SQL Server (Transact-SQL) is given below:

SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition(s)
GROUP BY column1, column2
ORDER BY column1, column2;

Example:

GROUP BY single column: To find the number of employee present in the Employee table in different age group sorted by Age (descending order), the query is:

SELECT Age, Count(Name) AS Number_of_Employee
FROM Employee
GROUP BY Age
ORDER BY Age DESC;


GROUP BY multiple columns: To find the average salary of employees present in the Employee table ordered by City and Age, the query is:

SELECT City, Age, AVG(Salary) AS AverageSalary
FROM Employee
GROUP BY City, Age
ORDER BY City, Age;
