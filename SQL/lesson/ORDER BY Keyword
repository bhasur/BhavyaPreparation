The SQL Server (Transact-SQL) ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result table in ascending or descending order. 
By default, ORDER BY keyword sorts the result in ascending order, however it can be specified using ASC keyword. 
To sort the result in descending order, DESC keyword is used.

Syntax
The syntax for using ORDER BY keyword in SQL Server (Transact-SQL) is given below:

SELECT column1, column2, column3, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;

Example:

To fetch the Employee table sorted by Age (ascending order), the query is:

SELECT * FROM Employee
ORDER BY Age ASC;

To fetch all fields of the Employee table sorted by Age (ascending order) and EmpID (descending order), the query will be:

SELECT * FROM Employee
ORDER BY Age ASC, EmpID DESC;
