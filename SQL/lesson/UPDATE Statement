The SQL Server (Transact-SQL) UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table. A WHERE clause can be used with the UPDATE statement to update the selected rows, otherwise all the rows will be assigned the updated value.

Syntax
The syntax for using UPDATE statement in SQL Server (Transact-SQL) is given below:

UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition(s);

Example:

To update the City and Salary of an employee whose EmpID is 5, the statement will be:

UPDATE Employee
SET City = 'Mumbai', Salary = 2900
WHERE EmpID = 5;

--see the update
SELECT * from Employee;



Similarly, to update the Salary of John who lives in London, the following statement can be used:

UPDATE Employee
SET Salary = 3200
WHERE Name = 'John' AND City = 'London';

--see the update
SELECT * from Employee;
