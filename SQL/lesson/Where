The SQL Server (Transact-SQL) WHERE Clause is used to specify condition(s) in a query. 
It can be used to specify condition(s) while fetching data from a table, joining two tables, updating records in a table, 
inserting records in a table or deleting records from a table.

Syntax
The syntax for using WHERE Clause in SQL Server (Transact-SQL) is given below:

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition(s);

Example:

To fetch Name, Age and Salary data from Employee table where Salary is greater than 2800, the query is:

SELECT Name, Age, Salary 
FROM Employee
WHERE Salary > 2800;

To specify multiple conditions logical operators are used, for example - 
To fetch data from the Employee table where Salary is greater than 2800 and Age is less than 30, the SQL Server AND operator is used and the query will be:

SELECT * FROM Employee
WHERE Salary > 2800 AND Age < 30;
