The SQL Server (Transact-SQL) WHERE clause conditions can be combined using AND, OR, and NOT operators. These operators are used to handle more than one conditions.

AND - Used to combine multiple conditions and displays a record if all the conditions separated by AND operator are true.
OR - Used to combine multiple conditions and displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR operator is true.
NOT - Used to display a record where the specified condition is not true.

Syntax
The syntax for using these operators in SQL Server (Transact-SQL) are given below:

/* AND Operator */
SELECT column1, column2, column3, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condtion3 ....;

/* OR Operator */
SELECT column1, column2, column3, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condtion3 ....;

/* NOT Operator */
SELECT column1, column2, column3, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE NOT condition;
