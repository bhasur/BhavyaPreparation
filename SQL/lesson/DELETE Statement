The SQL Server (Transact-SQL) DELETE statement is used to delete the existing records from a table. A WHERE clause can be used with the DELETE statement to delete the selected rows, otherwise all records will be deleted.

Syntax
The syntax for using DELETE statement in SQL Server (Transact-SQL) is given below:

DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition(s);


Example:

To delete the records of an employee whose EmpID is 5, the statement is given below:

DELETE FROM Employee
WHERE EmpID = 5;

-- see the result
SELECT * from Employee;


Similarly, to delete the records of an employee where city starts with 'New', the statement will be:

DELETE FROM Employee
WHERE City LIKE 'New%';

-- see the result
SELECT * from Employee;
