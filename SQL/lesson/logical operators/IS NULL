A field with no value is called a field with NULL value. 
To test the NULL value of a field, SQL Server (Transact-SQL) IS NULL operator is used. 
It returns TRUE if a NULL value is found, otherwise it returns FALSE.

Syntax

The syntax for using IS NULL operator in SQL Server (Transact-SQL) is given below:

SELECT column1, column2, column3, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NULL;

Example:
