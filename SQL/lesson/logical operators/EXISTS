The SQL Server (Transact-SQL) EXISTS Operator is used to test the existence of records from a subquery. It returns true if the subquery returns one or more records, else returns false.

Syntax
The syntax for using EXISTS operator in SQL Server (Transact-SQL) is given below:

SELECT column1, column2, column3, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE EXISTS 
(SELECT column_name FROM table_name
WHERE condition);

Example:
The below SQL Server statement returns TRUE and records of female employees from Employee table.

SELECT * FROM Employee
WHERE EXISTS 
(SELECT EmpID FROM Contact_Info 
WHERE Employee.EmpID = Contact_Info.EmpID AND Gender = 'F');
