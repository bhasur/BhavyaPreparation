The SQL Server (Transact-SQL) VIEW statement is used to create a SQL Server VIEW which is a virtual table created based on the SQL Server statement. A view contains rows and columns just like a normal table. All SQL Server functions, WHERE, HAVING and JOINs statements can be used to create a SQL Server VIEW. The SQL Server VIEW statement can be used to create, update or delete a view.

Syntax
The syntax for using VIEW statement in SQL Server (Transact-SQL) is given below:

/* Create a view */
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, column3, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition(s);

/* Update a view */
CREATE OR ALTER VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, column3, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition(s);

/* Drop a view */
DROP VIEW view_name;
