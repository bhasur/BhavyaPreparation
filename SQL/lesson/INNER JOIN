The SQL Server (Transact-SQL) INNER JOIN keyword (or sometimes called simple JOIN) is used to combine column values of two tables and 
returns all rows from both of the tables when there is a match between the columns.

Syntax
The syntax for using INNER JOIN keyword in SQL Server (Transact-SQL) is given below:

SELECT table1.column1, table1.column2, table2.column1, table2.column2, ...
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.matching_column = table2.matching_column;

Example:

To inner join Employee and Contact_Info tables based on matching column EmpID, the query is given below. 
This will fetch Name and Age columns from Employee table and Address column from Contact_Info table.

SELECT Employee.Name, Employee.Age, Contact_Info.Address 
FROM Employee
INNER JOIN Contact_Info
ON Employee.EmpID = Contact_Info.EmpID;


To fetch all fields of a table, table.* keyword is used, for example - to fetch all fields of the Employee table, Employee.* is used in the below query:

SELECT Employee.*, Contact_Info.Address 
FROM Employee
INNER JOIN Contact_Info
ON Employee.EmpID = Contact_Info.EmpID;

Join Three Tables
------------------------
Syntax
The syntax for joining three tables using INNER JOIN keyword in SQL Server (Transact-SQL) is given below:

SELECT table1.column1, table1.column2, ... 
  table2.column1, table2.column2, ...
  table3.column1, table3.column2, ...
FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2
  ON table1.matching_column = table2.matching_column
INNER JOIN table3
  ON table1.matching_column = table3.matching_column;
  
  
 To fetch a record containing EmpID, Name, Bonus and Address from these tables, the following query can be used:

SELECT Employee.EmpID, Employee.Name, 
  Bonus_Paid.Bonus, Contact_Info.Address
FROM Employee INNER JOIN Bonus_Paid
  ON Employee.EmpID = Bonus_Paid.EmpID
INNER JOIN Contact_Info
  ON Employee.EmpID = Contact_Info.EmpID;
  
  
  To fetch the above record but with a condition like Bonus should be greater than equal to 500, the following query can be used:

SELECT Employee.EmpID, Employee.Name, 
  Bonus_Paid.Bonus, Contact_Info.Gender, 
  Contact_Info.Address
FROM Employee INNER JOIN Bonus_Paid
  ON Employee.EmpID = Bonus_Paid.EmpID
INNER JOIN Contact_Info
  ON Employee.EmpID = Contact_Info.EmpID
WHERE Bonus_Paid.Bonus >= 500;
