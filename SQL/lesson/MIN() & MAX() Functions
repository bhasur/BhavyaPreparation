The SQL Server (Transact-SQL) MIN() function returns the minimum value of an expression or specified column of a table. 
Similarly, the SQL Server (Transact-SQL) MAX() function returns the maximum value of an expression or specified column of a table.

Syntax
/* Using MIN() Function */
SELECT MIN(column_name) 
FROM table_name
WHERE condition(s);

/* Using MAX() Function */
SELECT MAX(column_name) 
FROM table_name
WHERE condition(s);


/* Using GROUP BY with MAX() Function */
SELECT column1, column2, ...
       MIN(column_name) 
FROM table_name
WHERE condition(s)
GROUP BY column1, column2, ...;

/* Using GROUP BY with MAX() Function */
SELECT column1, column2, ...
       MAX(column_name) 
FROM table_name
WHERE condition(s)
GROUP BY column1, column2, ...;


Example - With Single Column

To fetch minimum Salary of the employees present in the Employee table, the query will be:

SELECT MIN(Salary) AS MinSalary 
FROM Employee;

To fetch maximum Salary of the employees present in the Employee table, the following query can be used:

SELECT MAX(Salary) AS MaxSalary 
FROM Employee;


Example - Using GROUP BY


To fetch the minimum Salary of the employees group by their age, where age is greater than 27, the following query can be used:

SELECT Age, MIN(Salary) AS MinSalary 
FROM Employee
WHERE Age > 27
GROUP BY Age;


To fetch the maximum Salary of the employees group by their age, where age is greater than 27, the query will be:

SELECT Age, MAX(Salary) AS MaxSalary 
FROM Employee
WHERE Age > 27
GROUP BY Age;
