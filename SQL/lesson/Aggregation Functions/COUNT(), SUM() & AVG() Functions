SQL Server COUNT() Function
---------------------------
The SQL Server (Transact-SQL) COUNT() function returns the count of an expression.

Syntax
The syntax for using COUNT() function in SQL Server (Transact-SQL) is given below:

SELECT COUNT(column_name) 
FROM table_name
WHERE condition(s);

The SQL Server GROUP BY clause is used to arrange result table into identical groups when one or more columns are used. 
Please note that it is must to include those column names in a GROUP BY clause which are not encapsulated within the COUNT() function. 
See the syntax below:

SELECT column1, column2, ...
       COUNT(column_name) 
FROM table_name
WHERE condition(s)
GROUP BY column1, column2, ...;


Example - With Single Column:

To get the count of employees whose age is greater than 25, the following query can be used:

SELECT COUNT(Name) AS EmployeeGT25 
FROM Employee
WHERE Age > 25;



Example - Using DISTINCT
The DISTICT clause can be used with COUNT() function. For example - To get the count of distinct (unique) age of the employees, the following code can be used:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Age) AS DistinctAge 
FROM Employee;



Example - Using GROUP BY
To get the count of employees group by their age, the following query can be used:

SELECT Age, COUNT(Age) AS NumberOfEmployee 
FROM Employee
GROUP BY Age;




SQL Server SUM() Function
--------------------------
The SQL Server (Transact-SQL) SUM() function returns the summed value of an expression.

Syntax
The syntax for using SUM() function in SQL Server (Transact-SQL) is given below:

SELECT SUM(column_name) 
FROM table_name
WHERE condition(s);

The SQL Server GROUP BY clause is used to arrange result table into identical groups when one or more columns are used. 
Please note that it is must to include those column names in a GROUP BY clause which are not encapsulated within the SUM() function. See the syntax below:

SELECT column1, column2, ...
       SUM(column_name) 
FROM table_name
WHERE condition(s)
GROUP BY column1, column2, ...;


Example - With Single Column

To get the combined total salary of all employees whose age is greater than 25, the following query can be used:

SELECT SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalary 
FROM Employee
WHERE Age > 25;



Example - Using DISTINCT
The DISTICT clause can be used with SUM() function. For example - To get the combined total salary of distinct (unique) salaries, the following code can be used:

SELECT SUM(DISTINCT Salary) AS TotalUniqueSalary 
FROM Employee;


Example - Using Formula
The expression contained within the SUM() function does not need to be a single field. 
A formula can also be used with this function. For example - Consider a bonus (15% of Salary) is given to each employee,
and to calculate the total bonus amount,the following query can be used:

SELECT SUM(Salary * 0.15) AS TotalBonusAmount
FROM Employee;


Example - Using GROUP BY
To get the combined total salary of employees group by their age, the following query can be used:

SELECT Age, SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalaryByAge 
FROM Employee
GROUP BY Age;




SQL Server AVG() Function
--------------------------
The SQL Server (Transact-SQL) AVG() function returns the average value of an expression.

Syntax
The syntax for using AVG() function in SQL Server (Transact-SQL) is given below:

SELECT AVG(column_name) 
FROM table_name
WHERE condition(s);

The SQL Server GROUP BY clause is used to arrange result table into identical groups when one or more columns are used. 
Please note that it is must to include those column names in a GROUP BY clause which are not encapsulated within the AVG() function. See the syntax below:

SELECT column1, column2, ...
       AVG(column_name) 
FROM table_name
WHERE condition(s)
GROUP BY column1, column2, ...;



Example - With Single Column

To get the average salary of employee with age greater than 25, the following query can be used:

SELECT AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary 
FROM Employee
WHERE Age > 25;


Example - Using DISTINCT
The DISTICT clause can be used with AVG() function. For example - To get the average value of distinct (unique) salaries, the following code can be used:

SELECT AVG(DISTINCT Salary) AS AvgUniqueSalary 
FROM Employee;


Example - Using Formula
The expression contained within the AVG() function does not need to be a single field. 
A formula can also be used with this function. For example - Consider a bonus (15% of Salary) is given to each employee, and to calculate the average of bonus amount,
the following query can be used:

SELECT AVG(Salary * 0.15) AS AvgBonusAmount
FROM Employee;


Example - Using GROUP BY
To get the average salary of employees group by their age, the following query can be used:

SELECT Age, AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalaryByAge 
FROM Employee
GROUP BY Age;
