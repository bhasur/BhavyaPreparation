The SQL Server (Transact-SQL) TOP Clause is used to fetch specified number or percentage of records from a table. This is useful when the table contains thousands of records and returning a large dataset can impact performance.

Syntax
The syntax for using TOP Clause in SQL Server (Transact-SQL) is given below:

SELECT TOP number|percent column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition(s);

Example:
To fetch top 3 records from the Employee table, the query is:

SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Employee;

The above result can also be achieved by using PERCENT keyword in the query.

SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT * FROM Employee;

To fetch top 3 records where the Age of the employee is greater than 25, the query will be:

SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Employee 
WHERE Age > 25;
