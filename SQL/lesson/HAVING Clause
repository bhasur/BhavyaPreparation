The SQL Server (Transact-SQL) HAVING clause is used to specify conditions with aggregate functions.
Note that the SQL Server (Transact-SQL) WHERE clause can not be used to specify conditions with aggregate functions.

Syntax
The syntax for using HAVING clause in SQL Server (Transact-SQL) is given below:

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition(s)
GROUP BY column_name(s)
HAVING condition(s)
ORDER BY column_name(s);


Example:

To fetch a list containing number of employees (from Employee table) in each city and only including cities with more than one employees, the query is given below:

SELECT COUNT(EmpID) AS Number_of_Employee, City  
FROM Employee
GROUP BY City
HAVING COUNT(EmpID) > 1;

To get above table sorted in descending order based on number of employees, the query will be:

SELECT COUNT(EmpID), City  
FROM Employee
GROUP BY City
HAVING COUNT(EmpID) > 1
ORDER BY COUNT(EmpID) DESC;

Using HAVING clause with JOINs: To fetch a list containing bonus paid to employees in each city and only including cities with more than one employees, the query is given below:

SELECT A.City, SUM(B.Bonus) AS BonusAmount
FROM Employee AS A
INNER JOIN Bonus_Paid AS B
ON A.EmpID = B.EmpID
GROUP BY City
HAVING COUNT(A.EmpID) > 1;
