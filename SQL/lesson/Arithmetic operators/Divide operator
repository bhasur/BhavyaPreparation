The SQL Server (Transact-SQL) / (divide) operator is used to divide two values. It operates on numerical values.

Using with WHERE Clause: To select records of table where division of Var1 column value by Var2 column value is greater than 6.0, the query is given below.

SELECT * FROM Sample
WHERE Var1 / Var2 > 6.0;

Using with AS Clause: The division of Var1 column value by Var2 column value can be displayed in a different column using AS clause:

SELECT *, (Var1 / Var2) AS Division FROM Sample;

Using with UPDATE Clause: To update the column Var1 with the division of Var1 column value by Var2 column value, the query is given below:

UPDATE Sample
SET Var1 = Var1 / Var2;

--See result
SELECT * FROM Sample;

Using with values: To divide two values, we can simply use SELECT statement:

SELECT 50 / 25;
