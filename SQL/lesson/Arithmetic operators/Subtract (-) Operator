The SQL Server (Transact-SQL) - (subtract) operator is used to subtract two values. It operates on numerical values.

Example:

Using with WHERE Clause: To select records of table where difference of Var1 and Var2 column values is greater than 20, the query is given below.

SELECT * FROM Sample
WHERE Var1 - Var2 > 20;

Using with AS Clause: The difference of Var1 and Var2 column values can be displayed in a different column using AS clause:

SELECT *, (Var1 - Var2) AS Diff FROM Sample;

Using with UPDATE Clause: To update the column Var1 with the difference of columns Var1 and Var2, the query is given below:

UPDATE Sample
SET Var1 = Var1 - Var2;

--See result
SELECT * FROM Sample;

Using with values: To subtract two values, we can simply use SELECT statement:

SELECT 50 - 30;
