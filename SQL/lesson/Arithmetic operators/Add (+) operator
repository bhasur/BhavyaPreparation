The SQL Server (Transact-SQL) + (add) operator is used to add two values. It operates on numerical values.

Example:

Using with WHERE Clause: To select records of table where sum of Var1 and Var2 column values is greater than 25, the query is given below:

SELECT * FROM Sample
WHERE Var1 + Var2 > 25;

Using with AS Clause: The sum of Var1 and Var2 column values can be displayed in a different column using AS clause:

SELECT *, (Var1 + Var2) AS SUM FROM Sample;

Using with UPDATE Clause: To update the column Var1 with the sum of columns Var1 and Var2, the query is given below:

UPDATE Sample
SET Var1 = Var1 + Var2;

--See result
SELECT * FROM Sample;

Using with values: To add two values, we can simply use SELECT statement:

SELECT 30 + 50;
