The SQL Server (Transact-SQL) * (multiply) operator is used to multiply two values. It operates on numerical values.

Using with WHERE Clause: To select records of table where multiplication of Var1 and Var2 column values is greater than 100, the query is given below.

SELECT * FROM Sample
WHERE Var1 * Var2 > 100;


Using with AS Clause: The product of Var1 and Var2 column values can be displayed in a different column using AS clause:

SELECT *, (Var1 * Var2) AS Prod FROM Sample;

Using with UPDATE Clause: To update the column Var1 with the product of columns Var1 and Var2, the query is given below:

UPDATE Sample
SET Var1 = Var1 * Var2;

--See result
SELECT * FROM Sample;

Using with values: To multiply two values, we can simply use SELECT statement:

SELECT 50 * 30;
