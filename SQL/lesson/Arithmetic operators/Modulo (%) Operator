The SQL Server (Transact-SQL) % (modulo) operator is used to calculate remainder of a division operation. It operates on numerical values.

Using with WHERE Clause: To select records of table where Var1 column value is divisible by Var2 column value, the query is given below.

SELECT * FROM Sample
WHERE Var1 % Var2 == 0;

Using with AS Clause: The value of Var1 % Var2 operation can be displayed in a different column using AS clause:

SELECT *, (Var1 % Var2) AS Remainder FROM Sample;

Using with UPDATE Clause: To update the column Var1 with the value of Var1 % Var2 operation, the query is given below:

UPDATE Sample
SET Var1 = Var1 % Var2;

--See result
SELECT * FROM Sample;

Using with values: To calculate the remainder of a division operation, we can simply use SELECT statement:

SELECT 100 % 60;
