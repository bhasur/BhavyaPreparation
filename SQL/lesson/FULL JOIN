The SQL Server (Transact-SQL) FULL JOIN keyword (or sometimes called FULL OUTER JOIN) is used to combine column values of two tables based 
on the match between the columns and returns all rows of the both tables. If there is no match in any table, the result table will contain NULL value.

The syntax for using FULL JOIN keyword in SQL Server (Transact-SQL) is given below:

SELECT table1.column1, table1.column2, table2.column1, table2.column2, ...
FROM table1
FULL JOIN table2
ON table1.matching_column = table2.matching_column;

Example:
To full join Employee and Contact_Info tables based on matching column EmpID, the query is given below. This will fetch Name and Age columns from Employee table and Address column from Contact_Info table.

SELECT Employee.Name, Employee.Age, Contact_Info.Address 
FROM Employee
FULL JOIN Contact_Info
ON Employee.EmpID = Contact_Info.EmpID;


To fetch all fields of a table, table.* keyword is used, for example - to fetch all fields of the Employee table, Employee.* is used in the below query:

SELECT Employee.*, Contact_Info.Address 
FROM Employee
FULL JOIN Contact_Info
ON Employee.EmpID = Contact_Info.EmpID;
