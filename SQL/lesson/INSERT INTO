The SQL Server (Transact-SQL) INSERT INTO statement is used to insert a new record in a table. 
There are two ways of using INSERT INTO statement which are mentioned below.

Syntax
The below syntax specifies column names and respective values to be inserted.

INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
The below syntax specifies values only. Therefore, it is essential to specify values in the same order as the columns in the table.

INSERT INTO table_name 
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);

Example:

Using below query, two new records are added in the Employee table:

INSERT INTO Employee (EmpID, Name, City, Age, Salary)
VALUES (7, 'Suresh', 'Mumbai', 29, 2900);
INSERT INTO Employee 
VALUES (8, 'Zayne', 'Oslo', 31, 3400);

-- see the result
SELECT * from Employee


Insert Data Only in Specified Columns: To insert data in specified columns, it is necessary to specify column names. See the query given below:

INSERT INTO Employee (EmpID, Name, Age)
VALUES (7, 'Suresh', 29);

-- see the result
SELECT * from Employee


Populate one table using another table
A table can be populated using another table by using INSERT INTO SELECT statement. 
Please note that the other table should have the set of fields which are required to populate in the first table.

Syntax
The syntax for using INSERT INTO SELECT statement in SQL Server (Transact-SQL) is given below:

INSERT INTO table1 [(column1, column2, ...)] 
SELECT column1, column2, ...  FROM table2
[WHERE condition];

Consider a database containing tables called Employee and HREmployee with the following records:

Table 1: Employee table

Table 2: HREmployee table

The HREmployee table contains no records and have following fields - HRID, Name and Address.

The given fields of HREmployee table can be populated using Employee table by using below query:

INSERT INTO HREmployee (HRID, Name, Address)
SELECT EmpID, Name, City FROM Employee
WHERE EmpID IN (1, 4, 5);

-- see the result
SELECT * from HREmployee
