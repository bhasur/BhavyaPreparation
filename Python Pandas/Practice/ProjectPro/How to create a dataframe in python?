Step 1 - Import the library

import pandas as pd  (Let's pause and look at these imports. Pandas is generally used for data manipulation and analysis.)


Step 2 - Setup the Data

Studentstable =  {"Name":["RAM","SITA","Bharath","leela"],
                  "Marks":[90,85,70,65]}

(Let us create a simple dataset and store it in the form of dictionary.)

Step 3 - Converting Dataset to Dataframe
(Now we simply use pandas library imported earlier to covert the dataset to Dataframe)


df=pd.DataFrame(Studentstable,columns=["Name","Marks"])

Step 4 - Printing Dataframe

print(df)
