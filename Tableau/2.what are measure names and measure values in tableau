When we connect any data set, tableau automatically generates some fields that contain multiple measures to create graphs that involve multiple measures. 
"Measure Names" and "Measure Values" are one of them.


Measure Values"
The "Measure Value" field contains all of the measures which are present in the data set, in one field with continuous values.

Measure Names"
The "Measure Names" field contains all the names of the measures, in one field with discrete values.
